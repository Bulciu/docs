# REST API
The REST API gives programmatic access to write and read operations over Retargeting.Biz data.

To use the REST API you need the REST API KEY from your Retargeting account. The API KEY is automatically generated on account registration.

# Retargeting REST API Client
You can use the Retargeting REST API Client to implement the REST API on your application.
